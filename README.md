# JavaScript: Unexpected Zero Division Handling
This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: unexpected handling of zero values during division. The `myFunc` function does not throw an error when dividing by zero, instead it returns 0 which might lead to unexpected behavior in the program flow.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.
